        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for two computer systems (like frontend and backend, or two different applications) to communicate over the HTTP protocol in a simple, scalable, and stateless manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.REST (Representational State Transfer)\n",
        "\n",
        ".It's an architectural style, not a protocol or standard.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Focuses on how resources (like users, products, orders) are represented and accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Resource-based\n",
        "\n",
        ".Everything is treated as a resource (e.g., /users, /products/10).\n",
        "\n",
        ".Resources are identified using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Stateless\n",
        "\n",
        ".Each API request contains all the info needed.\n",
        "\n",
        ".The server doesn’t store session/state between requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.HTTP Methods commonly used:\n",
        "\n",
        ".GET → Read data\n",
        "\n",
        ".POST → Create data\n",
        "\n",
        ".PUT/PATCH → Update data\n",
        "\n",
        ".DELETE → Remove data\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Data Format\n",
        "\n",
        "Most REST APIs use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), though XML or plain text can also be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-world Example**\n",
        "\n",
        ".Suppose we have a RESTful API for a Book Store:\n",
        "\n",
        ".GET /books → Fetch list of all books\n",
        "\n",
        ".GET /books/1 → Fetch details of book with ID=1\n",
        "\n",
        ".POST /books → Add a new book\n",
        "\n",
        ".PUT /books/1 → Update details of book with ID=1\n",
        "\n",
        ".DELETE /books/1 → Delete book with ID=1\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans**.-An API Specification is a detailed document (or file) that defines how an API works, what endpoints it has, what data it accepts, and what it returns.\n",
        "Think of it as the blueprint or contract between the API provider and the developer who uses it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Definition\n",
        "\n",
        ".It describes the structure, rules, and behaviors of the API.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Ensures both the client (consumer) and server (provider) understand how to communicate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What it Contains\n",
        "\n",
        ".Base URL → Where the API lives (e.g., https://api.example.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        ".Endpoints → The specific resource paths (e.g., /users, /orders/{id}).\n",
        "\n",
        ".HTTP Methods → Allowed actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
        "\n",
        ".Request Parameters → Query strings, headers, or body data.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Response Format → JSON/XML schemas, status codes, error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Authentication Rules → API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        ".Acts as a guidebook for developers.\n",
        "\n",
